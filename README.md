# C++-Through-Game-Programming

This will contain all the games that I create as I go through the book, Beginning c++ Though Game Programming, third edition, by Michael Dawson.

I'll be working on this over Easter and the begining of summer term. I will be uploading the game made at the end of each chapter as well 
as any code that I learn that I find interesting or can learn from.
